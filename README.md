# freeCodeCamp Project: Build a Tribute Page
This was my second freeCodeCamp certification project. The goal was to build a repsponsive, informational, tribute page about someone important
to you. I used HTML, CSS, and media queries to achieve the design outcome and make adjustments for different viewports.

Please feel free to take a look at my code. Thanks!
